# Introduction

This is the specification for the MSSQL standard library of [Ballerina language](https://ballerina.io/), which provides the functionality that is required to access and manipulate data stored in an SQL Server database.

The MSSQL library specification has evolved and may continue to evolve in the future. The released versions of the specification can be found under the relevant GitHub tag.

If you have any feedback or suggestions about the library, start a discussion via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues) or in the [Slack channel](https://ballerina.io/community/). Based on the outcome of the discussion, the specification and implementation can be updated. Community feedback is always welcome. Any accepted proposal, which affects the specification is stored under `/docs/proposals`. Proposals under discussion can be found with the label `type/proposal` in GitHub.

The conforming implementation of the specification is released to Ballerina central. Any deviation from the specification is considered a bug.

# 1. Overview

This specification elaborates on the usage of the MSSQL `Client` object to interface with an MSSQL database.

`Client` supports five database operations as follows,
1. Executes the query, which may return multiple results.
2. Executes the query, which is expected to return at most one row of the result.
3. Executes the SQL query. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
4. Executes the SQL query with multiple sets of parameters in a batch. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
5. Executes an SQL query, which calls a stored procedure. This can either return results or nil.

All the above operations make use of `sql:ParameterizedQuery` object, backtick surrounded string template to pass
SQL statements to the database. The `sql:ParameterizedQuery` supports passing of Ballerina basic types or typed SQL values
such as `sql:CharValue`, `sql:BigIntValue`, etc. to indicate parameter types in SQL statements.

# 2. Client

Each client represents a pool of connections to the database. The pool of connections is maintained throughout the
lifetime of the client.

**Initialisation of the client:**
```ballerina
# Initialize the MSSQL client.
#
# + host - Hostname of the MSSQL server
# + user - If the MSSQL server is secured, the username
# + password - The password of the MSSQL server for the provided username
# + database - The name of the database
# + port - Port number of the MSSQL server
# + instance - Instance name of the MSSQL server
# + options - MSSQL database connection options
# + connectionPool - The `sql:ConnectionPool` to be used for the connection. If there is no
#                    `connectionPool` provided, the global connection pool (shared by all clients) will be used
# + return - An `sql:Error` if the client creation fails
public isolated function init(string host = "localhost", string? user = "sa", 
        string? password = (), string? database = (), int port = 1433, string instance = "", 
        Options? options = (), sql:ConnectionPool? connectionPool = ()) returns sql:Error?;
```

**Configurations available for initializing the MSSQL client:**
* Connection properties:
  ```ballerina
  # Provides a set of additional configurations related to the MSSQL database connection.
  #
  # + secureSocket - SSL configurations to be used
  # + socketTimeout - Socket timeout (in seconds) to be used during the read/write operations with the MSSQL server
  #                   (0 means no socket timeout)
  # + queryTimeout - Timeout (in seconds) to be used when executing a query.
  #                  (-1/0 means no query timeout)
  # + loginTimeout - Timeout (in seconds) to be used when connecting to the MSSQL server and authentication (default is 15s).
  public type Options record {|
      SecureSocket secureSocket?;
      decimal socketTimeout?;
      decimal queryTimeout?;
      decimal loginTimeout?;
  |};
  ``` 
* SSL connection:
  ```
  # SSL configurations to be used when connecting to the MSSQL server
  #
  # + encrypt - Encrypt all data sent between the client and the server if the server has a certificate
  #             installed
  # + trustServerCertificate - The MSSQL server SSL certificate is automatically trusted when the communication
  #                            layer is encrypted using TLS
  # + cert - Keystore configuration of the trust certificates
  # + key - Keystore configuration of the client certificates
  public type SecureSocket record {|
      boolean encrypt?;
      boolean trustServerCertificate?;
      crypto:TrustStore cert?;
      crypto:KeyStore key?;
  |};
  ```

## 2.1. Handle connection pools

Connection pool handling is generic and implemented through `sql` module. For more information, see the
[SQL specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-sql/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md#21-connection-pool-handling)

## 2.2. Close the client

Once all the database operations are performed, the client can be closed by invoking the `close()`
operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients.

   ```ballerina
   # Closes the MSSQL client and shuts down the connection pool.
   #
   # + return - Possible error when closing the client
   public isolated function close() returns Error?;
   ```

# 3. Queries and values

All the generic `sql` queries and values are supported. For more information, see the
[SQL specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-sql/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md#3-queries-and-values)

In addition to `sql` values, the `mssql` package supports the following additional typed values for MSSQL Geometric and Money types,
1. CompoundCurveElement
   * LineStringValue
   * CircularStringValue
2. CircularArcRing
   * LineStringValue
   * CircularStringValue
   * CompoundCurveValue
3. GeometryCollectionElement
   * PointValue
   * LineStringValue
   * CircularStringValue
   * CompoundCurveValue
   * PolygonValue
   * CurvePolygonValue
   * MultiPointValue
   * MultiLineStringValue
   * MultiPolygonValue
4. MoneyValue
5. SmallMoneyValue

# 4. Database operations

`Client` supports five database operations as follows,
1. Executes the query, which may return multiple results.
2. Executes the query, which is expected to return at most one row of the result.
3. Executes the SQL query. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
4. Executes the SQL query with multiple sets of parameters in a batch. Only the metadata of the execution is returned.
5. Executes an SQL query, which calls a stored procedure. This can either return results or nil.

For more information on database operations see the [SQL specification](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-sql/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md#4-database-operations)
